\begin{frame}\frametitle{Symbolic Meaning}
{\sf  \em
The truths contained in religious doctrines are after all so distorted
and systematically disguised that the mass of humanity cannot
recognize them as truth.  The case is similar to what happens when we
tell a child that new-born babies are brought by the stork.  Here,
too, we are telling the truth in symbolic clothing, for we know what
the large bird signifies.

OWEN: You must understand I need you here, Luke.

LUKE: But it's a whole 'nother year.

OWEN: Look, it's only one more season.


LUKE: Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.


AUNT BERU: Where are you going?


LUKE: It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those
droids.

LEIA: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan
Kenobi. You're my only hope.

THREEPIO: Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old
data. Pay it no mind.

LUKE: Who is she? She's beautiful.

BEN: Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're
still in one piece.



LUKE: Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! 



BEN: The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young
Luke, what brings you out this far?

LUKE: I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like
the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right
now. It's such a long way from here.

BEN: These are not the droids your looking for.



TROOPER: These are not the droids we're looking for.

BEN: He can go about his business.

DODONNA: Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is
ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

WEDGE: That's impossible, even for a computer.

LUKE: It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my
T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Opening Image (1)
\item Theme Stated (5)
\item Set-Up (1-10)
\item Catalyst (12)
\item Debate (12-25)
\item Break into Two (25-30)
\item B Story (30)
\item The Promise of the Premise (30-55)
\item Midpoint (55)
\item Bad Guys Close In (55-75)

\item Dark Night of the Soul (75-85)
\item Break into Three (85)
\item Finale (85-110)
\item Final Image (110)
\end{enumerate}


\end{frame}
\begin{frame}\frametitle{THE BLAKE SNYDER BEAT SHEET}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Opening Image} (1) A visual that represents the struggle \& tone
  of the story. A snapshot of the main character’s problem, before the
  adventure begins.  
\item {\bf Theme Stated} (5) What your story is about; the message, the
  truth. Usually, it is spoken to the main character or in their
  presence, but they don’t understand the truth…not until they have
  some personal experience and context to support it. 
\item {\bf Set-Up} (1-10) Expand on the ``before'' snapshot. Present the main
  character’s world as it is, and what is missing in their life. 
\item {\bf Catalyst} (12) The moment where life as it is changes. It is the
  telegram, the act of catching your loved-one cheating, allowing a
  monster onboard the ship, meeting the true love of your life,
  etc. The “before” world is no more, change is underway.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}\frametitle{THE BLAKE SNYDER BEAT SHEET}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Debate} (12-25)  But change is scary and for a moment, or a brief
  number of moments, the main character doubts the journey they must
  take. Can I face this challenge? Do I have what it takes? Should I
  go at all? It is the last chance for the hero to chicken out. 
\item {\bf Break into Two} (25-30) The main character makes a choice and the
  journey begins. We leave the ``Thesis'' world and enter the
  upside-down, opposite world of Act Two. 
\item {\bf B Story} (30)  This is when there’s a discussion about the Theme
  – the nugget of truth. Usually, this discussion is between the main
  character and the love interest. So, the B Story is usually called
  the ``love story''. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}\frametitle{THE BLAKE SNYDER BEAT SHEET}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf 
The Promise of the Premise} (30-55) This is the fun part of the story. This is
  when Craig Thompson's relationship with Raina blooms, when Indiana
  Jones tries to beat the Nazis to the Lost Ark, when the detective
  finds the most clues and dodges the most bullets. This is when the
  main character explores the new world and the audience is
  entertained by the premise they have been promised. 
\item {\bf Midpoint} (55)  Dependent upon the story, this moment is when
  everything is “great” or everything is “awful”. The main character
  either gets everything they think they want (“great”) or doesn’t get
  what they think they want at all (“awful”). But not everything we
  think we want is what we actually need in the end. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}\frametitle{THE BLAKE SNYDER BEAT SHEET}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Bad Guys Close In} (55-75)  Doubt, jealousy, fear, foes both
  physical and emotional regroup to defeat the main character’s goal,
  and the main character’s “great”/“awful” situation disintegrates. 
\item {\bf All Is Lost} (75) The opposite moment from the Midpoint:
  “awful”/“great”. The moment that the main character realizes they've
  lost everything they gained, or everything they now have has no
  meaning. The initial goal now looks even more impossible than
  before. And here, something or someone dies. It can be physical or
  emotional, but the death of something old makes way for something
  new to be born. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}\frametitle{THE BLAKE SNYDER BEAT SHEET}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Dark Night of the Soul} (75-85) The main character hits bottom,
  and wallows in hopelessness. The Why hast thou forsaken me, Lord?
  moment. Mourning the loss of what has “died” – the dream, the goal,
  the mentor character, the love of your life, etc. But, you must fall
  completely before you can pick yourself back up and try again. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}\frametitle{THE BLAKE SNYDER BEAT SHEET}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Break into Three} (85) Thanks to a fresh idea, new inspiration,
  or last-minute Thematic advice from the B Story (usually the love
  interest), the main character chooses to try again. 
\item {\bf Finale} (85-110) This time around, the main character
  incorporates the Theme---the nugget of truth that now makes sense to
  them---into their fight for the goal because they have experience
  from the A Story and context from the B Story. Act Three is about
  Synthesis! 
\item {\bf Final Image} (110)  opposite of Opening Image, proving, visually,
  that a change has occurred within the character.
