\ns{\large The Art of Computer Game Design}
{\footnotesize
I dreamed of the day when computer games would be a viable medium of
artistic expression --- an art form. I dreamed of computer games
expressing the full breadth of human experience and emotion. I dreamed
of computer games that were tragedies, games about duty and honor,
self-sacrifice and patriotism. I dreamed of satirical games and
political games; games about the passionate love between a boy and
girl, and the serene and mature love of a husband and wife of decades;
games about a boy becoming a man, and a man realizing that he is no
longer young. I dreamed of games about a man facing truth on a dusty
main street at high noon, and a boy and his dog, and a prostitute with
a heart of gold.
